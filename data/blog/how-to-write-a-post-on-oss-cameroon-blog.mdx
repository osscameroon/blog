## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={6} />

---
The OSS Cameroon blog is open-source and built in a way that anyone can contribute by adding his own article.
The topic must be something about **programming, community, job search and career advice**.

All the projects are hosted in the [GitHub organisation of OSS Cameroon](https://github.com/osscameroon) including the blog that you can find at this link: [https://github.com/osscameroon/blog](https://github.com/osscameroon/blog)
and all the posts are hosted in the GitHub repository as a Markdown file.

**To continue with the next steps, it is mandatory to have a [GitHub account](https://github.com).**

## Fork the project
The first step is to fork the project to your own account. If you don't know what "fork" is,
check out [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to learn more.

Go the blog repository link: [https://github.com/osscameroon/blog](https://github.com/osscameroon/blog)

Click on the button to fork the as indicated on the picture below:

You will see the UI below:

The GitHub repository of the blog is now on your GitHub account.

**Note:** when forking the project, the repository's name can be anything you want.

## Set up the project on your local computer
Clone the project from your GitHub account. The link to the repository is `https://github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>.git`

On your local computer, clone the project with following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>.git
```

* Replace your `<your_username>` by your own GitHub username.
* Replace your `<repository_name>` by the repository's name you gave.


### Run the project locally
To run the project locally, run the command below:
```shell
cd oss-cameroon-blog
npm install
npm start
```
Open the browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You will see the blog homepage

## Add me as Author
A blog post can have one or many authors and to be added as an author, your information must be present in the folder `data/authors`.
If you have already written a post for this blog, can skip this part.

Copy the file `data/authors/newauthor.md` and give an username you want. The username must not be present in the folder `data/authors`

In my case, my username is **tericcabrel** so, I will duplicate the file with the following command:
```shell
cp data/authors/newauthor.md data/authors/tericcabrel.md
```

Open your author file and edit the information. Here is an example:
```md
---
name: Eric cabrel TIOGO
avatar: /static/images/authors/tericcabrel.png
occupation: Software Engineer
company:
email: tericcabrel@yahoo.com
twitter: https://twitter.com/tericcabrel
linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tericcabrel
github: https://github.com/tericcabrel
---
```

For the property **avatar**, make sure to copy your picture in the folder `static/images/authors`
Save and exit, and we are done for this part.

## Add a blog post
let say you want to write a post with the title: **Authentication with Google using Node.js**.

To add blog post, at the root project directory of the blog, run the command below:
```shell
npm run create-post
```

Provide an answer to questions prompted in the terminal.

![Run the project locally](/static/images/posts/write-post-oss-cameroon-blog/4-oss-article-create-post.gif)

The CLI will generate a file in the folder `data/blog`, you will find the file named `authentication-with-google-using-nodejs.mdx` open it,
and you will see the following content:

```md
---
title: Authentication with Google using Node.js
date: '2022-05-28'
tags: ['authentication','node','google']
draft: false
summary: a summary of the post
images: []
layout: PostLayout
canonicalUrl:
authors: ['tericcabrel']
---
```

You can edit these properties as you want.

## Start editing
The file is created, you can now use the Markdown syntax to write your article.
With MDX, you can go further by adding HTML tags directly in the Markdown

### Browse the while editing
To see how the article will be displayed while you are writing, start the application
```shell
npm start
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:300/posts/authentication-with-google-using-nodejs`

Now edit the content, save and the page will be refreshed automatically.

If you pay attention, the URL path `authentication-with-google-using-nodejs` is equivalent
to the filename inside the folder `data/blog` without the extension

### Add table of contents
The table of contents is useful to display a quick overview of the article and easily jump to the section we are interested in.

In the beginning of the article, add the line below:
```md
## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={3} />
```
The value of the property `toHeading` can be between **1 and 6**; it is the equivalent to **h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6**

`toHeading={3}` will display headings _h1, h2, h3_ in the table contents and ignore _h4, h5, h6_

## Commit and push
Once you finish writing your blog post and ready to publish online, you need to commit your changes and push to the remote repository.

We will create a new Git branch, commit the changes on that branch and push to remote repository.
I will call the branch `auth-google-node` but you can name it as you own.
```shell
git checkout -b auth-google-node
git add .
git commit -m "finish article about authentication with google in node.js"
git push origin auth-google-node
```

You will get the output similar to this

![Commit the changes and push](/static/images/posts/write-post-oss-cameroon-blog/5-oss-article-commit-push.png)


## Submit your article to the main blog

### Create a pull request

Go to project repository on your GitHub Account and create a pull request to the main blog repository on OSS Cameroon.


![Commit the changes and push](/static/images/posts/write-post-oss-cameroon-blog/6-oss-article-create-pull-request.png)


### When for your pull request to approved

At this step, members of OSS Cameroon will receive a notification of your pull request, review your posts.
If there are changes to apply, you will fix and update the pull request.

When no changes needed, the pull request will be merged and publish on the [https://blog.osscameroon.com](https://blog.osscameroon.com).

Congratulations, you published your article ðŸŽ‰
