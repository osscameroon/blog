OSS Cameroon is a community of Cameroonian developers created in January 2021 that aims to learn and share skills together.
Our main goal is to encourage developers to contribute to open-source by building projects that can be useful for our society.

We have a Telegram group of 450+ members where we discuss everything related to programming in a joyful environment.
We regularly organize talks to discuss various topics in the software industry; it is usually experienced developers who share their
experience building and deploying applications in production.

We also organize events to enforce team building; an event can be held remotely or physically.

- For online events, we have a coding dojo, random chat, quiz on programming topics, live coding, etc.
- For physical events, we do meetups in a restaurant and participate in other tech events as guests.
