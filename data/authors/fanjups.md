Hello World & Welcome to Planet FanJups 🚀 👋

I am a passionate and fanatic learner.

As an app, I regularly update myself.

Some contributions:

- [Open Source Society Cameroon's Js Generator](https://github.com/osscameroon/js-generator/commits?author=FanJups)
- [Google's Mug](https://github.com/google/mug/commits?author=FanJups)

Contributing to Open Source projects leads me to be a GitHub Artic Code Vault Contributor. The goal of [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) is to preserve open source software for future generations.

On November 2019, I wrote my first article [Applying CI/CD to Java Apps Using Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/applying-cicd-to-java-apps-using-spring-boot) -> [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FanJups/cicd-applied-to-spring-boot-java-app). It's a way to thank people who helped me to become the developer I am today and share my experiences.
