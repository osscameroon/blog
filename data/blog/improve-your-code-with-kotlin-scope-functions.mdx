# Improve your kotlin code with scope functions

## Overview

Scope functions are functions whose purpose is to run a bit of code and sometimes return a result. They are not mandatory but improve the readability of code.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" fromHeading={2} toHeading={2} />

## **let** function

`let` allows to use an object inside a separated scope.

### example 1

```kotlin
val sarcasm = "Programming sucks!".let {
    val sarcasmWithFont = it.mapIndexed { index, c ->
        val newChar = if (index % 2 == 0) {
            c.uppercase()
        } else {
            c.lowercase()
        }
        newChar
    }.joinToString("")
    "This is a sarcasm: $sarcasmWithFont"
}
println(sarcasm) /*This is a sarcasm: PrOgRaMmInG SuCkS!*/
```

### example 2

```kt
var secret_number = 10
secret_number.let{
    val triple = it * 3 // it = 10
    println("3 times $it equals $triple")
}
/* 3 times 10 equals 30*/
```

The **context** is an object on which you call a function. The word **it** refers to the context. Anything declared inside the lambda is not accessible outside. The function `let` returns the result of the lambda.
It's a common practice to use `let` with the [safe-call operator `?.`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html#safe-calls) to performs an action if an object is not `null`.

### example 3

```kt
name?.let{ println("His name is $it") }
```

## **run** function

`run` works like `let` except that you use the keyword `this` to refer to the context. You can also call `run` without context.

### example 1

```kt
data class Car(var name:String, var speed:Float)
...
val myCar = Car("Street Danger", 999f)
myCar.run{
    println("${this.name} : ${this.speed}")
}
```

You can also omit the `this`

```kt
data class Car(var name:String, var speed:Float)
...
val myCar = Car("Street Danger", 999f)
myCar.run{
    println("$name : $speed")
}
```

## **with** function

The function `with` works like `run` but it doesn't have context. It takes the object as argument.

### example 1

You can do the following

```kt
val window = Window()
with(window){
    setTitle("Great Software")
    setSize(640, 480)
    show
}
```

instead of

```kt
window.setTitle("Great Software")
window.setSize(640, 480)
window.show
```

## **apply** function

`apply` does the same thing as `with` but does not receive argument.

### example 1

```kt
val myCar = Car("Street Danger", 999f)
myCar.apply {
    name = "Road Snail"
    speed = 10f
}
```

## **also** function

`also` works like `let` but always returns its context.

### example 1

```kt
val dog = Dog()
dog.also{ it.bark()}.also{ it.sleep()}.also{ it.cry()}
```

## Conclusion

There are five scope functions in Kotlin. They mainly reduce code and make it more readable. When used wisely they avoid boilerplate codes. You should definitely master them.
