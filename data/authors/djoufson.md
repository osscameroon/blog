I am a passionate .NET developer with a love for programming and learning new things. I started as a freelance developer but found my true calling in open source development. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and contributing to the community.

I have experience building websites and developing complex enterprise applications. I am an active member of the .NET community, attending meetups and conferences, contributing to open source projects, and sharing my knowledge through blog posts and tutorials.
